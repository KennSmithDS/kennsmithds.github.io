                <h2>Choropleth Map - % of survey respondents who always wear a mask</h2>
                <p width=80%>The below choropleth map is based on a survey conducted by the New York Times that depicts
                    the % of
                    survey respondents for a given county that always wear a face mask. This is important because it
                    shows which states and counties have either progressive populations, or maybe have stricter
                    mandates. These added assumptions would need to be validated with more research into COVID mandates
                    in those regions.</p>
