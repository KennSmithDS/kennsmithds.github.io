                <h2>Choropleth Map - % of survey respondents who always wear a mask</h2>
                <p width=80%>The below choropleth map is based on a survey conducted by the New York Times that depicts
                    the % of
                    survey respondents for a given county that always wear a face mask. This is important because it
                    shows which states and counties have either progressive populations, or maybe have stricter
                    mandates. These added assumptions would need to be validated with more research into COVID mandates
                    in those regions.</p>

                <p>The visualizations belowe are generated using daily climatology data downloaded from NOAA's
                    <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/selectlocation" target="blank">Climate Data

                <h2>Dotplot for Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation - Okanogan and Chelan Counties</h2>
                <p width="80%">
                    For this dotplot, the X-axis represents the daily precipitation and the Y-axis is the maximum
                    temperature recorded, in a
                    given daily observation.
                    The data ranges from 2013 until beginning of October 2021, and includes features such as min and max
                    temperature, precipitation
                    and snow level on ground. There are more attributes available on NOAA's portal. This visualization
                    is useful because it shows a
                    linear relationship for each season between temperature and precipitation. The most obvious are a
                    positive correlation between
                    temperature and precipitation in fall, and a negative correlation between temperature and
                    precipitation in summer.
                    Such relationshisp are less clear in spring and winter.

                <h2>Histogram of Max Temperatures by Season</h2>
                <p width="80%">
                    For this histogram, we can confirm a few things that would be assumed to be true, e.g. that the
                    hottest days would be in summer. However, this visualization also shows something counter intuitive,
                    and that is that winter has a very similar distribution as spring, yet fall has the coldest days of
                    the year. This can be observed by noticing the placement and height of stacked bars for the seasons.
